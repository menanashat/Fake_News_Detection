# Fake_News_Detection
In this post, we explore the use of Python in building a machine learning model to detect fake news. We delve into the key steps involved, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. By leveraging Python's powerful libraries and tools for natural language processing and machine learning, we create a robust system that can classify news articles as real or fake. Join us on this journey to develop an accurate and reliable solution for combating misinformation and promoting information verification.
